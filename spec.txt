We will create an application called Learning Curve Management that allows users 
to record the subjects they are interested in and create journal entries as they 
learn something about each subject. The Learning Curve Management homepage should 
describe the site and invite users to register or log in. Once logged in, a user 
should be able to create new subjects and add new entries, as well as read and 
edit existing entries. The system will also display the days on which the user 
should review the subjects already added, based on the day they were added and 
the forgetting curve.
